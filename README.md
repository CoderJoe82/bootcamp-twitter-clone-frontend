## Overview

You will be working in teams to make a clone of a common [micro-blogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging) platform. 
You will be given a back-end API for you to form your front-end application around. The API will include endpoints relating to authentication, users, 
messages, and likes. Your project must incorporate a majority of the endpoints given in the API.

A portion of your grade will be based on your team-working ability. Please see [this document](https://gitlab.com/kenzie-academy/se_public_files/team-guidelines/-/tree/master)
for guidelines.

You will also be following the SCRUM process and, although everyone will be a developer and individual contributor, your team should account for the roles of Product Owner, 
Scrum Master, and QA Tester. Please see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k9kMzUTTIMKhR_SciLpi87k5CeMMcSjdQHUyo8hX42Y/edit) for more details. Your client has
asked for the following:

```
The logged in user's experience is the core of this application. So the client wants to establish this core experience first. 
Since this is a social application, the client would like the application to emphasize engagement and engaging with other users as much as possible.
They are also interested in establishing the look and feel of their visual brand early so that it can be reused throughout the rest of the application.
```



## Learning Objectives

- Practice building larger applications with React + Redux
- Practice using react-router-dom or connected-react-router
- Practice building a system architecture for an application
- Practice reading and understanding a 3rd-party back-end API
- Practice using a component library
- Practice following SCRUM processes and understanding/practicing SCRUM roles
- Practice communicating/working together as a team

## Getting Started...

1. Familiarize yourself with [the API](https://kwitter-api.herokuapp.com/docs/)
2. Mock out possible pages
3. Break pages out into possible component names
4. Discuss at what point will you hit the API, store data in your Redux store, use local state, how components will get the props they need to render
5. Discuss and research what component library you would like to use and which components you will use
6. We recommend trialing some components to get comfortable with how they work and which components you could use for which parts of your application.
7. Begin creating/using components to establish a general foundation of your app

A starter scaffolding is provided [here](https://gitlab.com/kenzie-academy/se/fe/final-projects/assessment---kwitter-frontend)

## Project Architecture

[Dependency Graph](https://kenzie-academy.gitlab.io/se/fe/final-projects/assessment---kwitter-frontend/dependencygraph.html)

## Submission

1. git repo url - this is the url that has your frontend kwitter project source code
2. heroku frontend url - this is the url for your front-end deployment (we will walk you through heroku deployment)
3. heroku backend url - this is the url for your copy of the backend kwitter api deployment (we will walk you through heroku deployment)
4. SCRUM board - this shows your scrum board which has tickets with descriptions and assignees. it could be a trello board or a gitlab/github project board or similar.
5. Retro board/notes - this shows that your team discussed how to improve its process through notes about what went well/what went poorly/action items. it could be general notes or a funretro.io board.
