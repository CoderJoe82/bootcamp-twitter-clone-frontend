## Overview

You will be working in teams to make a clone of a common [micro-blogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging) platform. You will be given a back-end API for you to form your front-end application around. The API will include endpoints relating to authentication, users, messages, and likes. Your project must incorporate a majority of the endpoints given in the API.

A portion of your grade will be based on your team-working ability. Please see this document for guidelines:

You will also be following the SCRUM process and although everyone will be a developer and individual congributor your team should account for the roles of Product Owner, Scrum Master, and QA Tester. Please see this document for more details:

### Learning Objectives

- Practice building larger applications with React
- Practice using connected-react-router
- Practice building a system architecture for an application
- Practice reading and understanding a 3rd-party back-end API
- Practice using a component library
- Practice following SCRUM processes and understanding/practicing SCRUM roles
- Practice communicating/working together as a team

## Getting Started...

We will specify the API you will be using to build your project, but the design, layout, and component architecture will be up to you

1. Familiarize yourself with the API
2. Mock out possible screens
3. Break screens out into possible component names
4. Discuss at what point will you hit the API, use local state, how components will get the props they need to render
5. Discuss and research what UI component library you would like to use and which components you will use
6. We recommend trialing some components to get comfortable with how they work and which components you could use for which parts of your application.

7. Begin creating/using components to establish a general foundation of your app

A starter scaffolding is provided here: [kwitter-starter](https://github.com/erics273/kwitter-starter)

## Submission

1. GitHub repo url - this is the url that has your frontend kwitter project source code
2. Heroku - this is the url that has your frontend kwitter project deployed to it
3. heroku url - this is the url that has your copy of the backend 
4. SCRUM board - this shows your scrum board which has tickets with descriptions and assignees. it could be a trello board or a gitlab project board or similar.
5. Retro board/notes - this shows that your team discussed how to improve its process through notes about what went well/what went poorly/action items. it could be general notes or a funretro.io board.
6. 5 lessons learned - each lesson should be a couple sentences which describe something significant you learned/experienced that will help you in the next group project to be more prepared. the whole team should contribute ideas for 5 lessons learned.
